# LinkedLists HW

Problem: Write a function that reverses a LinkedList

Your function should take in the head of a list as a parameter, and retun the head of the reversed linked list 


# If anyone wants a VERY hard problem-> popular algorithm implementation

Problem: Write a function that detects whether or not a linked list contained a cycle. 

Your function should take in the head of a list as a parameter, and return True is there is a cycle and False if there is not a cycle. 

NOTE: a cycle is defined as a node's next pointer pointing back to an earlier node in the list
